# IAP EEPROM ARRAY

In this example an array of `NUM_OF_ELEMENTS` and a struct are written in the flash of the MCU emulating EEPROM operations.
The example makes use of the In-Application Programming capability of the internal flash to offer non-volatile storage.

## Notes

Increasing the `NUM_OF_ELEMENTS` can quickly lead to RAM shortage.
